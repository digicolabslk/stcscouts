                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The first term of 1995 was a very successful one for
                                the scouts of the 16<sup>th</sup> Colombo Scout Troop.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">At the beginning of the term the Thomian Scouts
                                participated at the B.P’s Day celebrations; a community service project held at the Vihara
                                Maha Devi Park. We also participated in a community service project organized by C.
                                Kulatilake at the Cheshire Home, Mt. Lavinia.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The Annual Scout Relay Carnival organized by the
                                Colombo District scout branch was also held during the 1<sup>st</sup> Term. We emerged the
                                under 18
                                champions, over all runners up and brought credit to College.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">During the term, four of our scouts, B.R. Kulapala, D.
                                Aluwihara, H.D. Peiris, T.M.H. Bandara and C. Kulatilake did remarkably well to get the
                                President’s award which is the highest award that a scout could obtain.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">During the April holidays the scouts went on a training
                                camp to the National Scout Training Center in Mirigama. It was a very useful camp in which
                                we gained experience and knowledge in various fields related to scouting.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="font-weight-semi-bold">Term 2:</h4>



                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">This term was also a very active one for the scouts of
                                16<sup>th</sup> Colombo. During the beginning of the term scouts participated in the Job
                                Week. This
                                year juniors and seniors took keen interest in the Job Week and collected a handsome sum of
                                Rs. 60,000/+ which was to be utilised for troop activities.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">We also participated at the Sub District Rally which
                                was held at the Blind School. N.D. Aluwihara, A.R. Goonewardene, B.R. Kulapala, D.H. Peiris
                                and T.M.H. Bandara were awarded the President’s Scout badges.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Our Scouts participated in the Poson Lantern
                                competition. We were able to win both Senior and Junior competitions and brought credit to
                                the school. Many scouts concentrated on badge work and several proficiency badges were won
                                by both the senior and junior scouts.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Two of our senior scouts D.H. Peiris and T.M.H. Bandara
                                represented the country at the World Scout Jamboree held In Holland.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">President’s Scouts T.M.H. Bandara and M.D.H. Peiris
                                were selected to attend the 18<sup>th</sup> World Jamboree held in the Netherlands from
                                1<sup>st</sup> – 11<sup>th</sup>
                                August 1995. They were chosen as the two most outstanding scouts in the Colombo district,
                                and received a financial grant of Rs. 100,000/- for their expenses. Their selection has
                                brought much credit to the College and r congratulations to both of them.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">There were 25,000 scouts from all over the world who
                                attended this Jamboree the theme of which was ‘Future is now’. They tried to lay down a
                                foundation for a better future and lived and worked together irrespective of caste, race or
                                creed differences.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Participation in this World Jamboree was no doubt an
                                unforgettable and once in a life time experience for these two scouts. The Jamboree was
                                called the “Olympics of Scouting” since it is held once in four years.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Our Scouts have comeback after gaining tremendous
                                experience which they will use to develop the Scout movement in Sri Lanka and very specially
                                the Scout Troop of our Alma Mater.</p>

                                participated at the annual Colombo District Scouts’ Swimming and Diving Meet. We did
                                extremely well to emerge Champions in both swimming and diving competitions for the
                                2<sup>nd</sup>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The Thomian scouts participated in the Colombo District
                                Camporee during the vacation. This year too we managed to maintain our standards of scouting
                                by winning pennants for high camping standards on both inspections. We put up a great
                                performance to be placed first in the Sub Camp. </p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Our Scout Group was awarded the “Onally Gulamn Hussain

                                school.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Four of our junior scouts, A.A. Farook, S.N. Peter,
                                S.S. De Alwis and B. Peter did extremely well to win the “Green Cord”, the highest
                                achievement a junior scout can get. Five of our scouts were also awarded the President’s
                                Scout parchment. They are R. Ranasinghe, N.M. Seneviratne, A.R. Gunewardena, B.R. Kulapala,
                                and D.H. Peiris. One of our senior scouts C.A. Kulatilaka was awarded his President’s Scout
                                badge during the term.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">This term was a very special term one for the scouts of
                                16<sup>th</sup> Colombo. We participated in the Annual Scout week and organized special
                                activities for
                                all the events. The most important one was the “Beats of Scouting”, a Scouts’ and Guides’
                                get together to celebrate the “Friendship Day”. It was a significant event as the Chief
                                Commissioner Mr. M.M. Mohideen was invited as the Chief Guest to grace this occasion. The
                                Chief Commissioner of the guides, Mrs. Ramya Abeyakoon and Sub Warden Mr. R. Pakiyanthan
                                were also present. This was the first time in the history of Scouting in the country, that a
                                joint programme of this sort was organised along with the Guides. The bonds created between
                                the two Scout entities via programmes of this sort, showed early promise of a long-lasting
                                relationship.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Our scouts also took part in the “Jamboree on the Air”
                                programme” too.</p>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The smooth running of the Troop is mainly due to the
                                keen interest shown by our scouts. We are grateful to our National Training Commissioner and
                                Advisor to the Troop Mr. Daniel Edirisinghe, Group Scout Leader Mr. A.L. Victor, Scout
                                Leaders and Assistant Scout Leaders for their selfless dedication and assistance given to us
                                at all times.</p>


                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">We take pride in mentioning the appointment of our
                                Master-in-Charge Mr. D. Edirisinghe as an Asia Pacific regional representative and for being
                                the first Sri Lankan to be appointed to this post. He has brought great honour to school and
