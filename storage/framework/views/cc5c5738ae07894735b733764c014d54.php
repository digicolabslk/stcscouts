                            <h4 class="font-weight-semi-bold">Launching of the first site:</h4>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The first ever website of the Troop was launched at the Scout & Craft Exhibition – Tribal
                                Craft 2004, held from the 13th – 14th of February 2004. The site was one of the first ever
                                Troop websites to be launched by a Scout Troop in the country:</p>

                                <div class="col-md-12 align-self-center p-static order-2 text-center">
                                    <img src="<?php echo e(asset('images/Launching-the-first-site.jpg')); ?>"

                            </div>
                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The website was then officially handed over to the “Webmasters” of the Troop, an office
                                created to look into the IT related data handling in the Troop. From there on, the site was
                                developed to suit the developments in the field of Web Development in Computing with time.

                            <h4 class="font-weight-semi-bold">Updating of the site layout:</h4>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The site layout was changed in 2012, and the platform was changed to HTML 4.0 with added new
                                features and a more attractive look. The following is a glimpse of the site that was
                                updated:</p>

                                <div class="col-md-12 align-self-center p-static order-2 text-center">

                            </div>

                            <h4 class="font-weight-semi-bold">Switching to HTML 5.0:

                            </h4>

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">With the advent of HTML 5.0, as the Troop has always been the pioneers of the field of IT in
                                the local Scouting arena, a major step was taken to change the whole site to fit into the
                                new technology immediately. The 16th Colombo Cub Pack contents have also been synced to the
                                present site. The present site, which you are currently navigating, was launched by the
                                Warden of College, Prof. Indra de Soysa at the Group Committee meeting held on the 16th of
                                January 2014:</p>
