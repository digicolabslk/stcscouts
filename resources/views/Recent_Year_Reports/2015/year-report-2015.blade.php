                                 St. John’s Ambulance Training Course on the 7<sup>th</sup> & 8<sup>th</sup> of February. Approximately 30 Scouts took part
                                  at this course and they were evaluated on the knowledge of First Aid. At the end of the day the Scouts
                                   received certificates from the St. John’s headquarters for completing the course.

                                  Scout Troop took part at this event and gained several knowledge on innovative leadership, communication
                                   & social media and peace. One of a delegates W.H.S. Fernando was selected to be a part of the Colombo

                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The next event was the Troop Movie Night. This was the first time an event of
                                 this sort was organized. Held on the 20<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> February, the Scouts and the recruits were shown
                                  “Night at the Museum” followed by a BBQ dinner. This event was greatly enjoyed by the Junior Scouts 
                                  and led them to involve more in Scouting.

                                 the 22<sup>nd</sup> – 26<sup>th</sup> April. Sincere thanks goes to our new Scout Master Mr. Vijith De Silva for the support
                                  given throughout the camp. This camp turned out to be a tremendous success as it provided unforgettable

                                  etc. It is notable that the Mayors Flag team was able bring back the flag after a lapse of one year

                                 on the 31<sup>st</sup> October at the Deaf and Blind School, Ratmalana. The project was an immense success by
                                  inviting many other schools. The Scouts were able to entertain the disable students while they 
                                  realised how fortunate we were born without illness. We would like to extend our gratitude to Mr. Ishan
