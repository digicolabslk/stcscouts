                             <span class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;">Term 1:
                             </p>



                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The first term of the year 1996 was definitely a
                                 busy one with a lot of events on schedule for this term.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">We started off this year with the annual job week
                                 which went on from the 24<sup>th</sup>  January to the 11<sup>th</sup>  of February. This year this annual event 
                                 too took a different face. It was inaugurated with a walk from Ratmalana to Mount Lavinia. The
                                  minister of Industrial Development Mr. C.V. Gunaratne was the Chief Guest at this event. After 
                                  two weeks of dedicated work, the Thomian Scouts were able to collect a total of Rs. 80,000/-. We 
                                  also had a day’s programme out in the beach to teach the scouts the practical side of Scouting,
                                   in order to enhance their Scouting skills.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The 16<sup>th</sup> Colombo Scouts continued with their benevolent work by helping
                                 out the underprivileged. A community service project was held at the deaf school and also a couple
                                  of scouts helped out the blind school administration at their annual sports meet.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Four of our senior scouts completed their efficiency decoration. They are M.
                                 Mallawarachchi, K. P.L. Perera, D.N Peter and I.U.P. Suriyapperuma. The four of them and V. Samarasinghe 
                                 were selected to take part in an International Jamboree in Korea. We extend our heartfelt congratulations
                                  to them for their achievement.
                              </p>



                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Two of our scouts Beshan Kulapala and Ravin Gunawardene successfully completed
                                 Phase – I course for scout leaders and were elevated to the rank of Assistant Scout Leaders of the
                                  16<sup>th</sup> Colombo Scout Troop. We congratulate them on their worthy achieve­ments and look forward to
                                   their guidance and support to the troop in future endeavours.
                              </p>




                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The month of April, too was not an empty one for us. We were able to go to 
                                the Pedro Scout Training Centre and Camp there for five days. This was a Holiday camp in Nuwara Eliya organised specially
                                 for the scouts to enjoy and forget about their books after the tedious studying for the term exams.
                              </p>

                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4 text-start">
                             <span class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;">Term 2:
                             </p>



                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">As usual this term too was a busy one for the Thomian Scouts.
                              </p>



                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">A lot of variation was added to Saturday
                                 Scouting by way of having special programmes to enhance our scouts on their practical knowledge and
                                  scout skills. We started this by having a day’s programme on the beach with sessions on various
                                   aspects of scouting. We also included a time for swimming on our Satur­day programme for the scouts
                                    to practise for the swimming championship which was just round the corner.
                              </p>




                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">We organised a Leadership Training camp tor the junior and senior
                                 patrol leaders and their assistants to train them to perform their duties better and to be good
                                  and efficient leaders.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The Troop Night, too was a specialty in our list of activities
                                 for this term. It was held alter a lapse of 3 years and this time it ended up highly successful with
                                  the scouts giving away an excel­lent exhibition of talent at the inter patrol drama competition which
                                   was also in the agenda that night. We also had a camp fire or that day
                              </p>



                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Three senior scouts and three junior scouts represented the
                                 troop at the inter-troop General Knowledge competition organised by Royal College and our senior 
                                 scouts managed to secure the first and second places. We take great pride in mentioning that six of
                                  our scouts were chosen to represent So Lanka at the 17<sup>th</sup> Asia Pacific Jamboree held in Korea. The
                                   scouts are I.U.P. Suriyapperuma, M. Mallawarachchi, D.N. Peter, K.P.L. Perera, V. Samarasinghe and
                                    N.D. Dias. We congratulate them on their achievemen
                              </p>



                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">We continued to receive invitations for various District Scout and 
                                Guide activities, one of them was the campfire at Royal College of which the Chief Guest was
                                 Hon. Minister Mr. C.V. Goonaratne. We were also invited for the campfire at S. Thomas’ Prep.
                                  for which our presence was of great help. The guide troop of Manister College also invited us
                                   for their inter patrol sports Meet.
                              </p>



                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">We also look part in District activities such as the inauguration
                                 of the Bata Scout Shoe at Hilton and the Seamen’s Sunday, day at St. Peter’s Church in Fort.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Our scouts continued their social service by organising five
                                 community service projects. Two of them at the Blind School in Ratmalana, one at the Home for the 
                                 Elders at Moratuwa, one Cheshire Home at Mt. Lavinia and Deaf School Ratmalana.
                              </p>

                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4 text-start">
                             <span class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;">Term 3:
                             </p>


                             <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">As usual this term too was a very active one for the Thomian Scouts.
                                 The hard work put in by all the Scouts made the annual Colombo District Scout Camporee a great 
                                 success. We were able to top the list on both days of inspection and won the coveted “Onally Gullam
                                  Hussein Flag” for producing the most number of President’s Scouts and the “P.S.R. Rajamani Shield”
                                   for producing the highest number of first class Scouts.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">S. Samarasinghe, A.N. Manamperi, R.  Wanigatunga, S. Jayasuriya,
                                 C.S. Seneviratne and C.R. De Alwis were awarded the President’s Scout badges at the Camporee.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The next event for this term was the “Tidal Wave ‘96”. This
                                 was the first ever joint Scouts’ & Guides’ two day programme organized by the Thomian Scouts. This
                                  event which was held towards the latter part of the term was a great success with the participation 
                                  of about 150 Scouts and Guides.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">During the term we were invited by Ladies’ College and Musaeus College, for their campfires.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Finally we take the opportunity to thank our Master in Charge Mr. D. Edirisinghe and G.S.L.
                                 Mr. Victor for all the support and guidance given to us in order to make efforts a success and we also 
                                 thank all the A.S.L.s and Instructors for their support. May the 16th Colombo Scout Troop continue 
                                 to be “The Tribe of the Evening Star” as always…
