                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4"> The 16<sup>th</sup> Colombo Scout troop organized an online
                                 camp fire on the 16<sup>th</sup> of May through the Zoom app. It had to take place 
                                 online due to the prevailing situation of the country. This was the
                                 first ever online/virtual campfire conducted by the Troop over its near century of existence.
                            </p>


                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4"> The camp fire was declared open by Miss Wathsala Wijewickrama.
                            </p>

                              

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">  It was a well-organized event although there 
                                were a few technical problems. The camp fire went on for an hour
                                 and it was great fun to watch all the skits prepared by the juniors.
                            </p>


                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">At the end of the program we all got together
                                 to sing a few songs and the camp
                                 fire came to a close.  All in all the virtual camp fire was a huge success.
                            </p>
