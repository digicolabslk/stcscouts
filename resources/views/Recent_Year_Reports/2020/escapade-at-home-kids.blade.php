                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">“Escapade At Home Kids” was the junior event of the 2nd
                                year of Escapade, which is a fitness oriented event by the scouts of 16th Colombo. This year
                                it was adapted to the situation in the country due to Covid ’19. It was held from the 30th
                                April to 3rd May and was in partnership with ‘The Great Outdoors’.
                            </p>


                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">It was titled a “Virtual Fitness Challenge” following
                                the same background as the original event in the sense that at it’s core it was about
                                physical strength. Escapade Kids while in a way a watered down, easier version of it’s
                                counterpart, was unique because it was altered to appeal to the younger audience. It was
                                however, still a challenge to the participants and the final points were extremely close.

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">In the end, the scores were tallied with Inesh Fernando
                                emerging champion, Aritha Perera in 2nd place and Sandil Kekulandara in 3rd.
