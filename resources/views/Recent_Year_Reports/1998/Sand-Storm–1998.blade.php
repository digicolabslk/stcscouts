                               <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">Once the coastal winds blew away,<br>
                                   The dark prince put his guard away,<br>
                                   Seeing the opportunity the lords joined their hands,<br>
                                   And banished the dark prince to the mountain lands.<br>
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">Now with the dark prince out of the way,<br>
                                   The Lords needed a king for them to stay,<br>
                                   So they all gathered in the great court of honour,<br>
                                   And discussed about appointing another,<br>
                                   In the court were two great lands.<br>
                                </p>

                                   Both of them wanted to be the one,<br>
                                   So in the end a vote they had,<br>
                                   At the end the short lord was in the high stand,<br>
                                   With his small head covered with a mighty crown,<br>
                                   As ritual he wanted a chief vizar,<br>
                                   So in rode the Tall Dark and Handsome Lord.<br>
                                 </p>    


                                <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The 16th of cities was full of swords and shields,<br>
                                   And they were lying everywhere to be seen,<br>
                                   So to keep them guarded day and night,<br>
                                   The new king appointed the Black lord who was had to sight.<br>
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">After winning the C.P.J. shield the lords were bored,<br>
                                    So they went to camp in the Pallekalle zone,<br>
                                    At camp they had nothing much to do,<br>
                                    Than eat, sleep and “oblix” to keep their cool.<br>
                                </p> 


                                <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">On the 7th night the seniors announced war against the hierarchy,<br>
                                    and attacked their mighty tent the marquee,<br>
                                    Alas! When one tall, one short, one dark and one fair Lord<br>
                                    came out;<br>
                                </p> 


                                <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The seniors planned not to hang out;<br>
                                    The musketeers four started attacking to and fro,<br>
                                     On their way they found lord Sala on the floor,<br>
                                     When the tall musketeer told him kneel down,<br>
                                     All Sala managed to say was “Right Now!!!”<br>

                                     The lords cooked it out again with three sister hoods,<br>
                                     he lords made the sisters cook and clean,<br>
                                     While they enjoyed a hearty meal.<br>

                                 <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">After thanking the sisters’ for their hearty meal,<br>
                                    The lord decided to give them a treat,<br>
                                    So in the College “Boiler Room”,<br>
                                    They showed Titanic and got themselves lot of loot…<br>
                                </p>

                                     Shall we join up with some sisterhood?<br>
                                     And the 23rd of cities looked so good!<br>

                                    The grip on our sanity is very slender,<br>
                                    The light of the campfire is warm and bright,<br>
                                    As we sing and dance through the night.<br>

                                    While we sit round the fire in the setting sun,<br>
                                    Challenges and tests enrich our minds,<br>
                                    With knowledge and experience hard to find.<br>

                                    In the end it always brings out the best,<br>
                                    Sometimes it takes you to the library ten times a day;<br>
                                    And puts our clear captain’s sanity away…<br>
