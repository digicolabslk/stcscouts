                                objective of promoting environment conservation. The project is manoeuvred by planting
                                foliage in the back garden and on one of the side gardens of the scout room. This
                                project was initiated in relation to the ‘Go Green’ project that is currently
                                been carried out in College.

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">Scouts C.D. De Mel, A.A. Cader, S.C. Gajanayaka, N.J.
                                Wikkremathileke
                                and D.G.D. Colonne conducted community service projects in order to help those in need as a
                                requirement in the President’s Scout Award and they have achieved their President’s Scout
                                Awards.
                                The President’s Award is the highest award a scout could achieve while in school.

                            <p class="text-dark text-justify text-4">The troop is furthermore in the process of planning a
                                unique campfire titled “Centennial Flames 2012” to be held in February 2012 to celebrate a
                                centenary of selfless service of Scouting in Sri Lanka and in our College. An event of this
                                nature is being held in College after 2004, when the troop last organized “Tribal Craft” – a
                                unique Scout Exhibition.

                                the bonds built, the character established and the memories gained and the experiences would
                                never leave the hearts of the scouts. Our story would not be complete without acknowledging
                                those who made all of the above possible. We take this opportunity to thank the
