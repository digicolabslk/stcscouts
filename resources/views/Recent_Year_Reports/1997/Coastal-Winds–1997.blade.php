                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">Long long ago in a far off time,<br>
                              There was a land with much treachery and crime,<br>
                              The Sixteenth of cities, near a sea shore lay…<br>
                              Where all the brothers (of the brotherhood) of the land were;<br>
                              happy and gay…
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">Now in this land of the Sixteenth city,<br>
                              Ruled a dark prince, his lord and deity.<br>
                              As the dark prince of sat on his throne;<br>
                              Towards his subjects compassion and pity was shown,<br>
                              He said to his lords “I’ll do what I should”…<br>
                              So he sent his ambassador to bring in the sisterhood,<br>
                              The sisters despised him, from him their distance kept,<br>
                              But the lords of the city with contempt slept.<br>
                            </p> 
                                   
                                   
                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The lords played the ‘Rhythms’ fine,<br>
                              Now the sisterhood was ready to dine,<br>
                              Sounds of joy the prince did make.<br>
                              And swore no more hands that he shall shake;<br>
                            </p>    


                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The battle of ‘The Wave’,<br>
                              Now they needed a plan to get the sisterhood in,<br>
                              But the evil one’s rumours spread of possible sin,<br>
                              As the lords tried to keep the sister in their land at night,<br>
                              At High School the evil one’s gave all a fright…<br>
                            </p> 
                                
                                
                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">So lords with their heads hung low,<br>
                              With the royal ball a flop, the evil ones were made happy to know,<br>
                              During the night of loneliness,<br>
                              A film of colour from the lords made a mess,<br>
                              That very day the prince found his need to baffle,<br>
                              When the Lady sister refused to eat pineapple,<br>
                              She disapproved of the lunch at ‘The Wave’…<br>
                              The prince to satisfy his ‘Ladies’ taste, pastries and stuff he<br>
                              bought and gave.<br>
                            </p> 
                                
                                
                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The battle of the cooks,<br>
                              Out of all the sisters in the hood,<br>
                              Two sister schools above the rest they stood,<br>
                              Entranced may be for their beauty and sultry,<br>
                              The lords did invite them to cook it out in their country.<br>
                            </p> 


                               

                           <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The lords made them cook: and work to kill,<br>
                              At the end of the day they had their fill;<br>
                              Being a dirty cook was worth winning the prize,<br>
                              So the dark prince of R to the occasion did rise…<br>
                              Pocahontas has her day,<br>
                              Things went fine hail and hearty,<br>
                              Till one day the prince visited a party,<br>
                              Dancing and shouting as loud as he can,<br>
                              After trying his best he broke a fan,<br>
                              The court camps out…<br>

                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The court camps out…<br>
                              Now the lords they planned on the annual camp in the city,<br>
                              Built a mighty tower to make their camp site pretty,<br>
                              The mighty tower took the shape of an escalator,<br>
                              And was named after the Mused sister orders leader and major (actually sergeant),<br>
                              Like an Amazon Queen she kept her fellow sisters barred,<br>
                              She was a sibling to the previous leader none other than the “Container yard”;<br>
                              Finally the towers machine and visor,<br>
                              Was christened and named the “Lon thalizer”…<br>
                            </p> 


                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">Prep for the camp was coming around;<br>
                              When Frankenstein’s lab assistant started making a sound brought in by the Bishop who embezzles the cash,<br>
                              But by the brotherhood this assistant was trashed,<br>
                              To the camp in the city the sisters all came that way.<br>
                            </p> 


                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The lord seemed bored they had nothing to say;<br>
                              Things heated up at Lunch finally,<br>
                              When a sister almost choked on green chillies,<br>
                              Meanwhile the sisters of the Ladies order,<br>
                              Found the Sixteenth camp and crossed the border;<br>
                              The line was thin coz they thought they were it.<br>
                            </p> 


                            <p class="text-center  text-dark text-justify text-4">The lords took a stand and wanted them to split;<br>
                              Sorry said the lords with a curious cough ignoring their advances,<br>
                              The lords packed them off…<br>
                            </p>

                              Asked her to send the army at ‘Thilaka’ with all its force,<br>
                              Thus ended the dark prince’s attack;<br>
                              Defence lines were thin so he had to move back,<br>
                              The lords going great guns,<br>
                              Chases the dark prince as he runs…<br>

                              His appearance was quite of primitive nature,<br>
                              The self-proclaimed prince of R, the cities only traitor…<br>

                              By writing a poem he displayed his nature insane,<br>
                              Naming himself the prince of R. for his own sake,<br>
                              Little realizing that he was putting his fame at stake (if he had any)…<br>

                              This beast on his bike is always a mess,<br>
                              Coz self-respect he never did possess…<br>

                              Because of his inability, will never have a named life,<br>
